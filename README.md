# NonStop

This game is currently a work in progress. Currently the player pyshics are at an okay point with maybe some more fine tuning. I will be working on test levels for the player to play.

The basic concept of this game is a first person autorunner where the player runs at breakneck speed along a floating course with obstacles and the ability to stick to the ground.

Planned features:
A basic course for players to run on

Stretch goals:
3 courses with varying difficulty
Original music
Fun viewmodel animations
