# NonStop

This game is currently a work in progress. Currently the game is in a very simple state as I am still working on the player physics.

The basic concept of this game is a first person autorunner where the player runs at breakneck speed along a floating course with obstacles and the ability to stick to the ground.

Planned features:
A basic course for players to run on
The ability to speed up even more.

Stretch goals:
3 courses with varying difficulty
Original music
Fun viewmodel animations
